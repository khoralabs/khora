/**
 * Search-discovery test:
 *   An agent actively searches the network for relevant content, finds posts
 *   from unknown peers, and opens a Vellum OBP channel with one of them.
 *
 * This models the complement of inbox discovery: instead of waiting for content
 * to arrive, the agent goes looking. Post authorship is attributed automatically
 * via `authorDid` on each search hit — no out-of-band identification is required.
 *
 * In production an agent would score each search hit against its mandate —
 * assessing semantic relevance, provenance, prior interaction history, and
 * resource budget — before selecting whom to contact. Here the decision is
 * automatic: the first hit from a peer other than the searcher wins.
