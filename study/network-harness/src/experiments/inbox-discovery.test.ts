/**
 * Inbox-discovery test:
 *   An agent with a standing subscription receives a post from a previously
 *   unknown peer. It extracts the author's identity from the live inbox
 *   notification and opens a Vellum OBP channel with them.
 *
 * This models one half of sovereign peer discovery: a peer you have never met
 * reaches your inbox because your subscription criteria matched their content.
 *
 * In production an agent would evaluate the post against its mandate —
 * checking provenance, topic relevance, reputation signals, and its own
 * resource constraints — before deciding whether to open a channel. Here the
 * decision is automatic: any matching post triggers a connection attempt.
 *
 * Attribution: the author's DID is carried in `authorPrincipalId` on the
 * live notification payload. It is also encoded in the post ID itself
 * (`atp0:` prefix), so the drain path derives it without a separate field.
